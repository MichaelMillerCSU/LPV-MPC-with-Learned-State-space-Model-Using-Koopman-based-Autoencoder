# LPV-MPC-with-Learned-State-space-Model-Using-Koopman-based-Autoencoder
The code of paper "LPV-MPC with Learned State-space Model Using Koopman-based Autoencoder"
The file 'Approach_vanderpol.py' is the simulation of the LPV-MPC closed-loop operation of Van der Pol oscillator with a trained model which is the file 'AutoEncoder_20220414_4.pkl'
The file 'Approach_duffing.py' is the simulation of the LPV-MPC closed-loop operation of Duffing system with a trained model which is the file named  'AutoEncoder_20220418_duffing_2.pkl'
The file 'training.py' consists the datasets generated by RK-4 of Van der Pol system and Duffing system and the file 'AutoEncoder_20220418_duffing_2.pkl' and the file 'AutoEncoder_20220414_4.pkl' can be obtained from this file.
